To Do List
- Use accelerationForce for 100% reverse force again. Introduce and use braking variable as relying on a percentage of accelerationForce is too finicky.
- Fine tune vehicle properties for more realistic deceleration
- Fine tune box colliders for FWD and RWD driving.
- Test new box colliders without CentreOfMass.position when adding force.

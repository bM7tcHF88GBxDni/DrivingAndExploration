To Do List
- Fine tune vehicle properties for more realistic deceleration
- Create a coroutine to continue adding a weakening acceleration force after Vertical input stops.
- Test new box colliders without CentreOfMass.position when adding force.
- Experiment with a gear system for driving force to feel more natural at slower and higher speeds. Add max speed.

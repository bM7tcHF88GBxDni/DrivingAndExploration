To Do List
- Acceleration force is still applied in air, implement grounding
- Left and right reverse force application needs to be inverted
- Experiment with adjusting rotation point for a more natural turning control and feel
- Fine tune turning and acceleration variables
- Simple rectangle mesh shape collides with the even the smallest mesh collider, need some sort of step offset or amend mesh collider shape

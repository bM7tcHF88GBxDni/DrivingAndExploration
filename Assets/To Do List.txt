To Do List
- Limit angular velocity
- Fine tune vehicle properties for more realistic deceleration
- Experiment with a gear system for driving force to feel more natural at slower and higher speeds. Add max speed.
- Experiment with adjusting rotation point for a more natural turning control and feel
